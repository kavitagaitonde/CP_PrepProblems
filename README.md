## Problems

- [X] Print concentric rectangular pattern in a 2d matrix.
- [X] Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array of non-negative integers.
- [X] Given an array of non negative integers A, and a range (B, C),
 find the number of continuous subsequences in the array which have sum S in the range [B, C] or B <= S <= C.
- [X] Given an array, find the next greater element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array. The Next greater Element for an element A[i] is the first greater element on the right side of A[i] in array.
- [X] Given a singly linked list, modify the value of first half nodes such that :
 1st node’s new value = the last node’s value - first node’s current value
 2nd node’s new value = the second last node’s value - 2nd node’s current value
- [X] Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
- [X] Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.
